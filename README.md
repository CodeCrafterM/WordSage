# WordSage

WordSage is designed to handle various text processing tasks efficiently and asynchronously. By using FastAPI, it provides a high-performance web interface that can handle multiple requests concurrently. Celery is utilized for task queue management, allowing for background processing of time-consuming tasks. Redis serves as the message broker and the backend for storing task results, ensuring fast and reliable communication between different components of the system.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of WordSage is to provide a scalable and efficient platform for text processing. It can be used in various scenarios where text manipulation and analysis are required, such as data preprocessing, content analysis, and text-based automation tasks. The asynchronous nature of the system ensures that users can submit tasks and retrieve results without blocking their workflow, making it ideal for applications that require high throughput and low latency.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Task Processing:** Utilize Celery to handle long-running text processing tasks without blocking the main application thread.
- **FastAPI Integration:** Leverage the high-performance capabilities of FastAPI to provide a responsive and concurrent web interface.
- **Redis as Message Broker:** Use Redis for fast and reliable message brokering and task result storage.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Easily scale the application by adding more worker nodes to handle increased load.
- **Prometheus and Grafana Integration:** Monitor application performance and health using Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization.
- **A/B Testing with Istio:** Implement A/B testing for different versions of the text processing algorithms using Istio for traffic management.

## Development

For development instructions, including setting up the development environment, running unit tests, and using the linter, refer to the [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) file.

## Deployment

For deployment instructions, including deploying the application using Docker Compose and Kubernetes, refer to the [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) file.

## Considerations for Production

When deploying WordSage in a production environment, several factors should be taken into consideration to ensure scalability, reliability, and maintainability:

- **Redis Sentinel for Scalability:** Use Redis Sentinel for high availability and scalability of the Redis instance. Redis Sentinel provides monitoring, notifications, and automatic failover, which ensures that your Redis instance is always available.
- **Horizontal Scaling of Celery Workers:** To handle increased load, scale the Celery workers horizontally by adding more worker nodes. This ensures that the system can process a larger number of tasks concurrently.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to keep track of system performance and diagnose issues. Use tools like Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization.
- **Load Balancing:** Use load balancers to distribute incoming traffic evenly across multiple instances of the FastAPI application and Celery workers. This improves the system's reliability and performance.
- **Security:** Implement security best practices, such as using HTTPS, setting up firewalls, and securing API endpoints with authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Database Backup and Recovery:** Regularly back up the Redis database and have a recovery plan in place to restore data in case of failure.
- **Resource Management:** Monitor and manage resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O) to ensure that the system runs efficiently and does not run out of resources.
- **Environment Variables Management:** Use a secure method to manage environment variables, such as a secrets manager, to ensure sensitive information is not exposed.

> **Note:** The current version of WordSage is for demo purposes only. It is recommended to thoroughly test and optimize the application for your specific production environment.

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [email]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
